The purpose of this project is to provide you with an out of the box setup for redux, react and moltin to play together. It comes with:

utils/moltin: exported moltin API functions via the JS SDK

store.js: fully functional redux store including routerMiddleware from react-router-redux, browserHistory, a redux-logger, redux-thunk, and a comprehensive set of reducers to handle moltin data.

actions/actions.js: set of action creators to work with the reducers so that you can easily dispatch actions that use the moltin API.

components: set of container components that give you a skeleton for a basic commerce store.
